# TikTok Claims Classification Project 🎥

At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, we are given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow our careers. 🚀

## Project Background 📊
TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner.

To address this, TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. ⚙️

## My Approach 🚀
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on data for the claims classification project. I also used Tableau to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data. 📊

### Steps Followed 🛠️
1. **EDA and Cleaning**: I started by cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types where necessary.
2. **Visualization Selection and Creation**: I selected appropriate visualization types to explore the variables and relationships between them. These visualizations helped me gain insights and identify patterns in the data.
3. **Creating Plots**: Using Tableau, I created various plots to visualize the data. These plots were essential in understanding the distribution, trends, and correlations within the dataset.
4. **Sharing Results**: Finally, I compiled my findings into an executive summary to share with the TikTok team. This summary included key insights and actionable recommendations based on the data analysis. 📈

### Specific Project Deliverables 📝
With this project, I gained valuable practice and applied new skills as I completed the following tasks:
- Course 3 PACE Strategy Document to consider questions, details, and action items for each stage of the project scenario.
- Answering the questions in the Jupyter notebook project file.
- Cleaning the data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Creating data visualizations.
- Creating an executive summary to share the results.

This repository showcases these milestones and is indexed in my list of data projects on my portfolio. 🎯
